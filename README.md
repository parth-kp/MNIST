# MNIST

The Project Simply Works in Two Parts:
<ol>
  <li> Training the Model, Which is MNIST model, of 60000 HandWritten Digits Dataset.
  <li> After Training Using It to Predict the Number Written on The Screen

    MNIST DATASET:- 
    
It has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.
The original black and white (bilevel) images from NIST were size normalized to fit in a 20x20 pixel box while preserving their aspect ratio. The resulting images contain grey levels as a result of the anti-aliasing technique used by the normalization algorithm. the images were centered in a 28x28 image by computing the center of mass of the pixels, and translating the image so as to position this point at the center of the 28x28 field.
MNIST contains image with their solution to train model as shown below.
